# Placelore

An iOS app that tracks the places you visit and generates frequency reports and behavior summaries — with an offline-first trajectory analysis pipeline for trip detection and transportation mode inference.

> The Xcode project, scheme, and bundle ID still use the original `PlaceNotes` identifiers. Only the user-facing display name is `Placelore`.

## Features

* **Tracking Control** — Enable, disable, or pause tracking (1h / 4h / 24h) with auto-resume
* **Frequent Places** — Weekly (7-day) and monthly (30-day) rankings by qualified stays and total minutes
* **Configurable Stay Threshold** — Only visits exceeding a configurable duration count as qualified stays
* **Interactive Map** — Top places displayed on Apple Maps with category-specific icons and tappable annotations
* **Monthly Report** — Consolidated summary with top places, total tracked time, time-of-day behavior chart
* **Milestone Notifications** — Get notified when a place reaches visit milestones (5, 10, 25, 50, 100)
* **Place Categorization** — Auto-detects place types (Restaurant, Gym, Cafe, Park, etc.) via Apple MapKit
* **Raw Location Sampling** — Persists every GPS update with full sensor metadata for offline analysis
* **CSV Export** — Export raw location samples for external trajectory analysis

## Research: Two-Stage ST-DBSCAN for On-Device Trip Detection

Placelore doubles as a research platform for studying lightweight trajectory analysis on mobile devices. The app collects rich GPS data (coordinates, timestamps, speed, course, accuracy) which feeds into an offline analysis pipeline.

### Background

[ST-DBSCAN](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2006.01.013) (Birant & Kut, 2007) extends classic DBSCAN by adding a temporal distance threshold, enabling density-based clustering on spatiotemporal data. However, vanilla ST-DBSCAN is O(n²), making it impractical for long trajectories on resource-constrained mobile devices.

We propose a **two-stage decomposition** that reduces complexity while preserving detection quality:

```
Raw GPS stream
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Stage 1: Temporal Gap  │   Split trajectory wherever consecutive
│     Segmentation        │   points are > τ_gap apart (default 10 min)
└──────────┬──────────────┘
           │  n segments
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Stage 2: Spatial       │   Run standard DBSCAN (eps, MinPts) within
│     DBSCAN per segment  │   each segment — no time dimension needed
└──────────┬──────────────┘
           │
           ▼
  Stay points + Trips + Transport mode
```

**Complexity**: O(n²) → O(Σ nₖ²), where nₖ is the size of each temporal segment — a significant speedup in practice since most segments contain far fewer points than the full trajectory.

### Analysis Pipeline

The `scripts/` directory contains a zero-dependency Python pipeline:

```bash
# Basic usage — only accepted (filtered) points
python scripts/st_dbscan_pipeline.py data/location_samples.csv

# Include all points (including rejected-speed for transport mode analysis)
python scripts/st_dbscan_pipeline.py data/location_samples.csv --use_all

# Custom parameters
python scripts/st_dbscan_pipeline.py data/location_samples.csv \
    --tau_gap 600 \    # Stage 1: time gap threshold in seconds
    --eps 50 \         # Stage 2: spatial distance in meters
    --min_pts 3        # Stage 2: minimum points per cluster
```

**Output files:**
- `*_annotated.csv` — Original data with added `segment_id`, `cluster_id`, `label` (stay/moving) columns
- `*_trips.json` — Structured trip summaries with origin/destination coordinates, duration, distance, average speed, and inferred transport mode

### Transport Mode Inference

Each detected trip is classified using speed-based heuristics from the `rejected-speed` points (which contain valid GPS readings during motion):

| Mode | Speed range | Source |
|------|------------|--------|
| Walk | < 7.2 km/h | Zheng et al., UbiComp 2008 |
| Bike | 7.2 – 21.6 km/h | Zheng et al., UbiComp 2008 |
| Drive | > 21.6 km/h | Zheng et al., UbiComp 2008 |

### Data Schema

The app persists every `CLLocation` update as a `RawLocationSample` with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `latitude` | Double | WGS84 latitude |
| `longitude` | Double | WGS84 longitude |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 | UTC timestamp |
| `horizontalAccuracy` | Double | GPS accuracy in meters |
| `speed` | Double | Speed in m/s (-1 if unavailable) |
| `altitude` | Double | Altitude in meters |
| `verticalAccuracy` | Double | Vertical accuracy in meters |
| `course` | Double | Heading in degrees (0–360) |
| `filterStatus` | String | `accepted` / `rejected-accuracy` / `rejected-speed` |
| `motionActivity` | String | CoreMotion activity (if available) |

## Requirements

* macOS with Xcode 15+
* iOS 17.0+ deployment target
* [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (for project generation)
* Python 3.9+ (for analysis scripts — no external dependencies required)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install XcodeGen

```
brew install xcodegen
```

### 2. Generate the Xcode project

```
xcodegen generate
```

This reads `project.yml` and produces `PlaceNotes.xcodeproj`.

### 3. Open in Xcode

```
open PlaceNotes.xcodeproj
```

## Running Debug vs Release

### Debug Build (default in Xcode)

Select **Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme > Run > Build Configuration > Debug**, then run on a simulator or device.

Debug mode includes:

* **Mock data seeding** — 8 sample places (cafes, gyms, restaurants, etc.) with randomized visits over 30 days are auto-inserted on first launch, so you can test all views without physically moving around
* No real location tracking required
* Full UI is functional with sample data

### Release Build

Select **Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme > Run > Build Configuration > Release**, then run on a **physical device** (location services don't work well on simulator).

Release mode includes:

* **Real location tracking** via `CLVisit` monitoring (battery-efficient)
* **Auto place categorization** using `MKLocalPointsOfInterestRequest` to detect nearby POIs
* Reverse geocoding for place names
* No mock data — all data comes from actual visits

### Quick Toggle

You can also switch between Debug and Release from the scheme selector:

1. Click the scheme name in Xcode's toolbar
2. **Edit Scheme...** > **Run** > **Info** tab
3. Change **Build Configuration** to `Debug` or `Release`

## Running Tests

### Locally via command line

```
# Generate the project first (if not already done)
xcodegen generate

# Run all 59 unit tests
xcodebuild test \
  -project PlaceNotes.xcodeproj \
  -scheme PlaceNotes \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro,OS=latest' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

### In Xcode

1. Open `PlaceNotes.xcodeproj`
2. Select the `PlaceNotes` scheme
3. Press **Cmd+U** to run all tests

### CI (GitHub Actions)

Tests run automatically on:

* Every **push to `main`**
* Every **pull request** targeting `main`

The workflow installs XcodeGen, generates the project, builds, and runs all tests. Results are uploaded as an artifact.
